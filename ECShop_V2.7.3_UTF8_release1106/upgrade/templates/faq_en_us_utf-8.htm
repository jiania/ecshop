Ask：Does the upgrade program depend on the client environment very much?<br />
Answer：In order to prevent the server side timeout, in order to support an unlimited version upgrade, we move "Loop and jumps
" out of the client side ，so your browser should support JavaScript1.5+. This demand simply negligible on the time that the IE7 has released long age and the FF2 is in fashion.<br /><br />

Ask：The version of my ECSHOP is very low, then too big the datasize, does the upgrade program supply "insurance" to these?<br />
Answer：It is no exaggeration to say, this program is custom to you, wo do a lot of work in this respect, please update feel at ease.<br /><br />

Ask：I am a programer，i do some change on the data list structure, can it effect the upgrading?<br />
Answer：The program think about kinds of abnormalities already, even if you change the data list structure, the process of upgrade program also can going fluently. You can take a rest. but, need to emphasize that：the changes youhave done will be covered, and reset as default data list structure of the new ECSHOP.<br /><br />

Ask：The program show that there is alot of wrong clearly, but it goes on upgrading, is it OK?<br />
Answer：To be at ease, there are two ranks of the wrong in the program：NOTICE and ERROR. When it is a NOTICE rank wrong, it means there is a wrong happened in the process, but these is tolerable, master program can good running normally. But the ERROR rank wrong is fatal, the program will stop immediately, so as the upgrading process. So, you must deal with the situation according to diffent questions when wrong happens.<br /><br />

Ask：What can i do when i want to report the wrong in the process of the program to the official as i have forget already?<br />
Answer：Don`t worry, all false infomation are recorded in the files under /data/ directory, those are named in the shape of upgrade_xxx.log, and can be opened and browsed by normal editor.<br /><br />

Ask：WHen an interrupt occurs in the process of program：browser shut illegaly、computer shut unexpectedly、network cut unfortunately、server just hangs……is there remedial measures？<br />
Answer：Remedial measures is just to rerun the program. Take it easy!<br /><br />

Ask：I have upgrade to the new release successfully, but i am fault-finding, want to upgrade again, is that ok?<br />
Answer：It is surely, you just change the release number smaller in the table ${prefix}shop_config, and run again。
